# Development Steps Log

**Project**: VitalGo Co
**Started**: 2025-09-17
**Purpose**: Step-by-step development audit trail

## Session 1 - Project Initialization
**Date**: 2025-09-17

### Step 1: Context Review
- **Action**: Read and understood DEV_CONTEXT.md
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**: Reviewed modular monolith architecture, hexagonal backend, atomic frontend design, and AWS deployment strategy

### Step 2: Documentation Setup
- **Action**: Created DEV_STEPS.md for development audit trail
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**: Established documentation process for tracking all development steps

---

### Step 3: Project Structure Creation
- **Action**: Created complete template directory structure following DEV_CONTEXT specifications
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - Created backend/ with hexagonal architecture (slices, shared, alembic, docker)
  - Created frontend/ with atomic design structure (slices, shared, app, styles)
  - Added core files (main.py, pyproject.toml, package.json, docker-compose.yaml)
  - Initialized 'home' slice in both backend and frontend

---

### Step 4: Backend Dependencies Setup
- **Action**: Installed and configured backend dependencies and tools
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - Initialized Poetry project with proper pyproject.toml
  - Installed FastAPI stack: FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, AsyncPG, Redis, Pydantic
  - Added security tools: PyJWT, Bcrypt, Python-JOSE
  - Added development tools: Pytest, Black, isort, Flake8, MyPy
  - Created main.py with basic FastAPI app and health endpoints
  - Verified all dependencies import successfully

---

### Step 5: Frontend Dependencies Setup
- **Action**: Installed and configured frontend dependencies and tools
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - Initialized Next.js 15 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Turbopack
  - Installed UI stack: Radix UI components, Lucide React, class-variance-authority
  - Added state management: Zustand, SWR, React Hook Form
  - Configured development tools: Prettier with Tailwind plugin
  - Restructured src/ directory following atomic design + slicing architecture
  - Created basic app structure with layout and home page
  - Verified build process works successfully

---

### Step 6: Architecture Validation
- **Action**: Validated backend and frontend structures against DEV_CONTEXT standards
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - Backend: Completed hexagonal architecture with proper slicing (application/domain/infrastructure)
  - Frontend: Confirmed atomic design + slicing architecture with App Router exception
  - Both structures now fully comply with DEV_CONTEXT standards

---

### Step 7: Server Testing
- **Action**: Started and tested both backend and frontend servers
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - Backend: FastAPI running on port 8000 with health endpoints working
  - Frontend: Next.js running on port 3000 with Turbopack
  - Architecture: Confirmed App Router mapping to slice components works
  - CORS: Properly configured for frontend-backend communication
  - Both servers ready for development

---

### Step 8: Tailwind CSS Configuration Fix
- **Action**: Fixed Tailwind CSS styles not being applied due to incorrect content paths
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Issue**: Tailwind config was using generic paths that don't exist in our slice architecture
- **Solution**: Created tailwind.config.ts with DEV_CONTEXT-compliant paths:
  - `./src/slices/**/*` - Where actual styled components live
  - `./src/shared/**/*` - Shared components with styles
  - Excluded `/src/app/` (routing only), `/src/pages/` (doesn't exist), `/src/components/` (doesn't exist)
- **Result**: Frontend now displays proper styling with centered layout and green badge

---

### Step 9: Homepage Structure Creation Following DEV_CONTEXT Architecture
- **Action**: Created complete homepage structure following DEV_CONTEXT atomic design + slicing principles
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - Created atomic design hierarchy in `src/slices/home/components/`
  - Atoms: Reusable base components (Button, Badge, Card) with variants
  - Molecules: Combined components (FeatureCard, StatCard, TestimonialCard)
  - Organisms: Complex sections (HeroSection, FeaturesSection, TestimonialsSection, CTASection)
  - Templates: Layout wrapper (HomeLayout)
  - Pages: Final composition (HomePage) using all components
  - All components include mandatory data-testid attributes for testing
  - Frontend compiles successfully with new structure
- **Architecture**: Followed slice-first principle - all components start in specific slice, move to shared only when reused

---

### Step 10: Tailwind CSS 4 Configuration Fix
- **Action**: Fixed Tailwind CSS 4 not applying styles due to incorrect configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Issue**: Tailwind CSS 4 requires different syntax than CSS 3 - styles were generated but not applied
- **Solution**:
  - Changed `globals.css` from `@tailwind base/components/utilities` to `@import "tailwindcss"`
  - Added explicit color definitions in `tailwind.config.ts` for CSS 4 compatibility
  - Maintained proper slice-based content paths
- **Result**: All Tailwind styles now working correctly (buttons, spacing, colors, responsive grid)
- **Learning**: Tailwind CSS 4 uses new import syntax and requires explicit color definitions

**Next**: Continue with step-by-step development
